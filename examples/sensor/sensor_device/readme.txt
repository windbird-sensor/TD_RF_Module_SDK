Sensor Device template for new TDxxxx RF module projects.

This example project use EFM32 CMSIS, the emlib peripheral library, the
libttdcore utility library and the libtdsensor library monitoring capabilities
to provide a skeleton Sensor Device (LAN slave) application template.

If not registered to a Sensor Gateway, the Device will register upon startup
automatically.
