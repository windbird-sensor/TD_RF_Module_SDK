LAN RX example.

This example project use EFM32 CMSIS, the emlib peripheral library,
the libttdcore utility library and the libtfrf library to demonstrate
a simple LAN receiver that receives a message from a LAN network, and
sends an acknowledgment response containing the received payload.

A random delay of up to 2 s is added for test purposes.
