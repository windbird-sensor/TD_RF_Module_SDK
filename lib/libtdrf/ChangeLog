# Version 2.0.0 #
  * Added TD_LAN_Restart(), TD_LAN_Process(), TD_LAN_SetFrequencyLevel() and TD_LAN_ReadLatchedRSSI() to public API
  * Added TD_SIGFOX_RelayId()
  * Added AT_LAN AT parser extension
  * Added AT_LAN AT parser extension

# Version 3.0.0 #

## Major Updates ##

 * Supports modules with SIGFOX ID >= 0x10000 (still retaining compatibility with smaller 16 bit IDs)
 * Now supports SIGFOX protocol V1 by default

## Changes ##

### BOOTLOADER: ###

  * Added TD_BOOT_ConfigureRadio() for performing the intial RF chip configuration
  * Added TD_BOOT_Exec_InitData() for performing the initial GPIO configuration

### LAN: ###

  * Moved GET() macro to libtdcore utils as GET_BITFIELD()
  * Moved SET() maro to  libtdcore utils as SET_BITFIELD()
  * Added TD_LAN_GetUserCallback()
  * Added TD_LAN_ReadLatchedRSSI()
  * Added TD_LAN_LastError()
  * Added TD_LAN_GetFrequency()
  * Added TD_LAN_GetPowerLevel()
  * Added TD_LAN_isActive()

### SIGFOX: ###

  * Added TD_SIGFOX_PowerVoltageExtended() to get the supply voltage while transmitting with a better accuracy
  * Removed the non-API function TD_SIGFOX_FrequencySet()
  * Renamed the non-API function TD_SIGFOX_MainRfPower() to TD_SIGFOX_RfPower()
  * Removed the non-API function TD_SIGFOX_RelayId() as it is non longer possible to relay SIGFFOX IDs with SIGFOX protocol v1

## Bug Fixes ##

### RF: ###

  * Bulletproof handling of RF chip mode (sleep/Idle/Receive/Transmit) transitions

### LAN: ###

  * Major rewrite of LAN functions, it is heavily recommended to not mix devices with a `libtdrf` library older than v4.0.0
  * Better error handling and reporting

### BOOTLOADER: ###

  * Extension of the bootloader to provide customization parameters: LED status pin location, optional update blink indication, RF channel selection, etc.

# Version 4.0.0 #

## Major Updates ##

### SIGFOX: ###

  * Bidirectional (down-link) communication
  * Transparent (use sender's SIGFOX ID) or non-transparent (use proxy's SIGFOX ID) SIGFOX proxy

## Changes ##

### LAN: ###

  * Fast LAN mode: once synchronized, transmitter and receiver can exchange data at maximum speed
  * Custom transmit (user callback function to write into FIFO) and receive (user callback function to read from FIFO and stop RX)
  * Changed the TD LAN windowed listen period to variable up to 6.7 s instead of fixed 1 s, using the  `LAN_PERIOD` and `LAN_ADDRESS_SIZE` configuration parameters
