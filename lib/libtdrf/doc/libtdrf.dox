\section Overview

The tdrf library contains high-level functions that make use of the on-board RF chip either for Sigfox transmission or
for short range communication.

\section Detailed Description

\subsection Sigfox
files: td_sigfox.h, td_sigfox_downlink.h, td_sigfox_proxy.h

Provides the Sigfox transmission function, with both uplink and downlink capabilities, and with support for either direct, proxy or transparent proxy transmissions.

\subsection LAN
file: td_lan.h

Provide a set of functions to use the RF chip as a short range modem thus allowing communication
between several modules while keeping low power consumption thanks to window mode. Listen before Talk
is also implemented in order to avoid collisions.

TD_LAN_Process() should be added in UserLoop for the LAN to work properly. Please keep in mind that while
Frame reception is made in interrupt, User callback will be called oustide interrupt context within TD_LAN_Process.

\subsection Boot
file: td_boot.h

Provide a bootloader function which allow over-the-air update of the module on start-up.

\section Limitation

\subsection Sigfox

As a Sigfox emission requires accurate timing and last several seconds which means it can not be executed within an interruption.
Please keep in mind that during a Sigfox Transmission, NOTHING else can be processed.

\subsection LAN

When sending a message, a module will wait up to 200ms for a ACK. Therefore the receiving module must send its ACK
as soon as possible to make sure it will be received. As calling the user function (in which the ACK should be sent)
for frame reception is made TD_LAN_Process, other functions within UserLoop may delay frame reception leading to a
missed ack.

\section Examples

  - sigfox: send sigfox frames
  - lan_rx: start LAN reception and display received messages
  - lan_tx: send LAN messages and display ack
  - gateway: show how to forward a LAN message via sigfox
